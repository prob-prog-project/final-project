# Final Project

This is the final project repository for Joy and Alexander 

Modified single cell hierarchial poisson/gamma model with a gaussian mixture prior

# NOTE

scanpy does not properly install via pip. You must run 

conda install scanpy

after installing the requirements.txt file

The gamma mixture model takes around 10 minutes to run 
and the hierarchial model takes around 1 hour on GCP.

Locally the gamma takes ~30 minutes and the hierarchial takes multiple hours.
